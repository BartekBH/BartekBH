# Hi, I am Barteküë®‚Äçüíª

I am a System Analyst at Data Warehouse and functional programming enthusiast. I am passionate about technologies and love to learn new things.


## ‚ö° About me

Here are some of the skills I have acquired during my learning journey:

In my daily routine, I extensively use SQL and data modeling. During my free time, I enjoy expanding my knowledge in Scala and functional programming.

I'm currently fascinated by actors model development with Akka, and you can find one of my projects here: https://github.com/BartekBH/akka-shop

Also I'm interested in compilation theory and I made simple compilator which you can see here: https://github.com/BartekBH/tiny-basic-compilator

I'm committed to writing clean code and constantly improving my skills and knowledge.
